## Surface Pro 6 Power Benchmark

*Mar. 4 2021* 


I benchmarked my Microsoft Surface Pro 6 model's power consumption with a power monitor. The model features an Intel i5-8350U chip. Watts in different usage circumstances are shown bellow.

| Condition | Power Consumption |
| :--------- | :----------------- |
| Sleep | ~ 0.5 W |
| Screen on, no interaction (varying brightness) | 4 ~ 9 W |
| OneNote, scroll with fingers | 11 ~ 12 W|
| OneNote, write with a pen | 12 ~ 19 W|
| Touch, select icons on Desktop | ~ 20 W|
| Heavy CPU/GPU load | > 30 W |

Surface Pro 6 is designed with a 45 Wh battery. Therefore, continuous usage of the touch screen and the pen will quickly drain the battery in few hours.
